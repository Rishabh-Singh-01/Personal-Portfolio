This is a website I made for myself as well as a side project (kind of ig....).

This majorly uses React and custom CSS, which I hand coded , each and every line by myself. This site only includes leaflet as library, everything else is written by yours truly.

This is a responsive website, tho it needed many changes to reach the satisfaction level I need it to be. Also, this by not any means the most optimal, best way or by any standard a very clean and consise code.This needs a lot of refactoring and different tweaking which I am going to do in the future. I could have done it in my first try or atleast tried to but I decided to complete this project as soon as possible and once deployed, will take care of subtle but important nuiances.

PS: Please note I took major inspiration of design from vcard-personal-portfolio by codewithsadee(github username) and color combination inspiration from website made by Brittany Chiang, and by no means I claim that its my original design but code written completely by me is different and original to me.
